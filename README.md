# Java-Http

## An awful HTTP server library for Java.

ExpressJS-style server library which allows easy creation of a HTTP server with Java. Java-Http is non-blocking, and is based on the built-in Java Http library (`com.sun.net.httpserver`).

Note that if you are looking for an actually *good* library, look elsewhere: there are already countless better options. I'm not normally a Java programmer.
